  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>What I'm working towards in my personal life is to be a really good soccer player, 
    as well as being a really nice and reliable person. I would like to be a lawyer as my professional life, 
    I am hard working with everything I'm determined in, and that is one of them. Some values I consider most necessary for my success in life are my religion,
    the people I surround myself with, dedication, and specially ,
    determination. Some of the short term goals I hope to accomplish in the near future are making my first 100$,
    being the best worker of the month, helping people out, finding god, donating for charity's and many many more , 
    in general, I would like to help people while I'm helping myself.
    Some of the character traits and achievements I most want to be know for are for being someone nice, reliable, honest, hard-working, motivated,
    and being someone known for following god.</p>
